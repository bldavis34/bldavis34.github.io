            <h3>From the author of The Hollow Inside, a twisty, gripping tale about a girl who delights in the macabre...until a friend gets murdered.</h3>

            


            <p>The history of the Clark family is full of untimely deaths and disappearances; many believe they are cursed. But instead of cowering from her family's past, Roxie Clark is fascinated by it. Using her flare for performance, she's weaved her ancestors' history into a lucrative ghost tour. But six months ago, tragedy struck closer to home when her sister Skylar's boyfriend was found stabbed in a cornfield. Skylar is distraught, and Roxie is desperate to help her find answers and closure. Instead, Skylar becomes obsessed with finding the killer. As the sisters dig, Roxie realizes that everyone in town may be hiding somethingâ€¦ and are some secrets best left untold?</p>

                <h2>The Hollow Inside</h2>
                <h3>A gripping, twisty, thought-provoking YA debut about a girl caught in a web of betrayal and revenge.</h3>



                <p>Phoenix and mom Nina have spent years on the road, using their charm and wits to swindle and steal to get by. Now they've made it to their ultimate destination, Mom's hometown of Jasper Hollow. The plan: bring down Ellis Bowman, the man who ruined Nina's life.

                After Phoenix gets caught spying, she spins a convincing story that inadvertently gives her full access to the Bowman family. As she digs deeper into their secrets, she finds herself entrenched in the tale of a death and a disappearance that doesn't entirely line up with what Mom has told her. Who, if anyone, is telling the whole truth?

                Debut author Brooke Lauren Davis explores the murkiness of right and wrong, of choices and consequences and heroes and villains, in an eerily compelling and wholly satisfying small-town saga.</p>
